# Primrose Photography (Work in Progress)
Primrose Photography is a photography website I developed as my final project in my WEB 2500/2620 course. The site captures the brandâ€™s essence by showcasing a portfolio of stunning photographs captured by Primrose Rosenthal, a fictional photographer. Visitors can explore the portfolio, learn about the range of photography services offered, and easily connect with Primrose Photography to create lasting memories.
